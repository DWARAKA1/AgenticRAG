Agentic RAG System Documentation

Introduction
This is a sample document for testing the Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. 
The system combines the power of large language models with document retrieval capabilities.

Key Features
1. Document Processing: The system can process PDF documents and extract text content.
2. Vector Storage: Documents are converted to embeddings and stored in a vector database.
3. Intelligent Retrieval: When users ask questions, the system retrieves relevant document chunks.
4. Answer Generation: The LLM generates answers based on the retrieved context.

Technical Architecture
- Frontend: Streamlit web application
- LLM: Groq API with Llama models
- Embeddings: HuggingFace sentence transformers
- Vector Store: ChromaDB for local storage
- Document Processing: LangChain document loaders and text splitters

Usage Instructions
1. Place PDF documents in the data/ directory
2. Click "Process PDFs" to create the vector store
3. Ask questions about your documents in the chat interface
4. The system will provide answers based on document content

Benefits
- Fast and accurate document search
- Context-aware answer generation
- Easy-to-use web interface
- Local processing for privacy
